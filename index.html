                <p>"Man has always jumped, without doubt it always made sounds.
                    From these chaotic noises and movements, singing and dance were born.
                    But it's not by rediscovering the lightness of chaotic jumps that the artist can amazeus; 
                    It's not excessive rigidity what stops you from giving yourself to dancing?
                    Taming chaos, yes; Put him in a cage, no!"- <strong>Ausloos,G (2003)</strong>
